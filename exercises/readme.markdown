# This is a XeLaTeX class to produce woking sheets for a course on LaTeX.

## Files
There are three types of files important: the class file (as documente tex, dtx), the exercises and the solution files. All three are needed to typeset a sheet with solutions. Sheets are also typesettable without solutions.

## How to Compile
Use XeLaTeX format to compile the source file lcourse-hd.dtx. The resulting pdf is the documentation, the cls file is the class needed to typeset exercises. If class option [solution] is set in a document the corresponding file "filename-solutions.tex" is needed to compile the document.
